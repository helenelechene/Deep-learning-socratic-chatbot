## The Socratic questioning

The Socratic questioning or Socratic maieutics is a conversation style used by the philosopher Socrate (470BC-399BC) in the Ancient greek. It is well illustrated in the writings of Plato (428/427BC-348/347BC) such as *Theaetetus*.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field obtained by mixing three disciplines: Linguistics, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. It is based on the interaction between machines and human languages. The basis of NLP is thus that the computer understands, manipulates but also generates natural language elements. To do so, the NLTK (which stands for Natural Language Toolkit) library is one of the most powerful ones in Python.
